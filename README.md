# ChainCounter
Develop a chain counter for a boat

## Background
Our current Chain Counter has failed after 12 years in the sun and the new models are too big to fit into the space on 
the console. Why not develop a new chain counter to fit into the old case?


## Hardware Design
See the [hardware directory](./hardware) for further information. 
We are using [KiCad]([Ihttps://www.kicad.org/) for hardware design. See the [Schematic of current version](./hardware/KiCad/schematic_current_version.pdf).
